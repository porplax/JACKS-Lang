# JACKS <sup><sub>**Yes. Another (JVM) toy language.**</sub></sup>
```
$ This is a comment btw.
puts('Hello World!')
```
JACKS is influenced by Python, Fortran, and Rust, which makes it easy to learn. 

- Interoperable with Java classes
- No super classes or main methods (it's already programmed in).
- No terminators (;) required.

It utilizes **ASM** for class generation and has it's own parser and lexer. 


## About
JACKS is nothing more than a generic toy language, made for fun. It has no uses that it specializes in.
So should you use JACKS? I dunno :P, it can be a great tool for creating projects like a simple web server, visualization, and such.
