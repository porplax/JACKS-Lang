$ Welcome, This is the first JACKS compiler!
$ Variables and basic functions are the only commands that are implemented.
$ In other words, the only commands that are implemented are 'puts' and 'concat'.

$ 'puts' will print a anything that is provided in the call.
$ 'concat' will concatenate multiple types of objects.

$ I hope you'll enjoy using the JACKS compiler.
$ Check out other compilers made by people like me!

sticks: int = 5 + 5 $ This statement will create a variable.
stones: int = sticks * 2
bones: int = sticks + stones

msg: str = concat(sticks, ' ', stones, ' ', bones) $ Concatenate the 3 variables...
puts(msg) $ Output them!
